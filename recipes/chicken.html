    <p>
        This is one of the most simple, yet tasty dishes that I like to make. It's not a lot of ingredients, so you can cook without having to 
        think too much about the recipe, making it great for those days where you don't really want to cook but still want something relatively
        healthy.

        I like to pair this with some rice, whether that's plain white rice or Spanish rice, which I absolutely love! I also usually pair with
        a green of some sort, like brocolli or asparagus, but you can do really anything you want on the side, or nothing at all!
